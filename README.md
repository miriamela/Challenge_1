# Challenge_1 ðŸš€

- Implement an endpoint which receive a variable and not typed numbers of arguments and return the sum of numeric values.
- Implement a second endpoint which return the history of calls made to the first endpoint.
- Create a form calling the first endpoint and showing the sum.
- Create a call to the second endpoint and implement the data visualisation.
- Implement some testing to validate the service.

This was my solution, no dounbt a partial one. I intend to keep working, at least, on the testing side! ðŸ™‚
